# Apixu changing policy and operating under the new name "weatherstack"

In October 2019 Apixu will stop working, the business has been renamed "weatherstack". The new business no longer provides a free forecast but does provide current weather.

Since the forecast will no longer be free I will not be adaping this library to the new service.

Please consider using the DarkSkyWeather library instead:

https://github.com/Bodmer/DarkSkyWeather

# ESP8266 and ESP32 Apixu weather client

Arduino client library for https://www.apixu.com/

Collects current weather plus daily forecasts.

Requires the JSON parse library here:
https://github.com/Bodmer/JSON_Decoder

The ApixuWeather_Test example sketch sends collected data to the Serial port for API test.
